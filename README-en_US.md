## Introduction

This repository provides most of the source code for PCL, including the UI library, animation module, download module, Minecraft launch module, and more!

Most of PCL code was actually created several years ago during my student days... back then, my English was not good... so there are often weird naming conventions, and problems like high coupling, no singleton, and messy code... um, I am not going to rewrite all this stuff from scratch, so just bear with it based on the principle of *if it runs, it is fine*, and please do not be too harsh...

## Some Uninteresting Details
- Do not think you will find clues to decrypt the game here, that part of the code has been removed
- The code related to unlocking hidden themes has also been removed, so do not think about bypassing decryption.jpg
- The source code repository is not updated in real-time, but is manually synchronized once each time PCL is updated
